(rayserve-overview)=

Ray Serve is a scalable, framework-agnostic model serving library for building online inference APIs. Serve integrates with any ML framework including PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-Learn, and more. It's particularly well suited for model composition and many model serving, and includes performance optimizations for serving LLMs such as response streaming, dynamic request batching, multi-mode/multi-GPU serving, and more.

Ray Serve is built on top of Ray, so it easily scales to many machines and offers flexible scheduling support such as fractional GPUsâ€”so you can share resources and serve many machine learning models at low cost.

## Quickstart

Install Ray Serve and its dependencies:

```bash
pip install "ray[serve]"
```
Define a simple "hello world" application, run it locally, and query it over HTTP.

```{literalinclude} doc_code/quickstart.py
:language: python
```

## More examples

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} Model composition

Use Serve's model composition API to combine multiple deployments into a single application.

```{literalinclude} doc_code/quickstart_composed.py
:language: python
```

:::

:::{tab-item} FastAPI integration

Use Serve's [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) integration to elegantly handle HTTP parsing and validation.

```{literalinclude} doc_code/fastapi_example.py
:language: python
```

:::

:::{tab-item} Hugging Face Transformers model

To run this example, install the following: ``pip install transformers``

Serve a pre-trained [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) model using Ray Serve.
The model we'll use is a sentiment analysis model: it will take a text string as input and return if the text was "POSITIVE" or "NEGATIVE."

```{literalinclude} doc_code/transformers_example.py
:language: python
```
